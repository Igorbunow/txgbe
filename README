Module parameters
=================
- sfp_i2c_fix (bool, default 0)
  Optional workaround for some 10G copper SFP modules where reading a 16-bit
  word from the internal PHY over the I2C/MCU bridge may return the low byte
  as a duplicate of the high byte. When enabled, the driver reads the word as
  two separate single-byte transactions for debugging and validation.
