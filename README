Module parameters
=================
- sfp_i2c_fix (bool, default 0)
  Optional workaround for some 10G copper SFP modules where reading a 16-bit
  word from the internal PHY over the I2C/MCU bridge may return the low byte
  as a duplicate of the high byte. When enabled, the driver reads the word as
  two separate single-byte transactions for debugging and validation.

- csum_iplen_fix (int, default 1)
  Controls how the IP header length is encoded in Tx context descriptors
  used for checksum/TSO offloads.
  * 1: use DWORD units (4-byte). This is the default.
  * 0: legacy mode (2-byte words). Keep for regression testing only.
  NOTE: this parameter is module-load-only (read-only at runtime). Changing it
  while the device is running may wedge Tx and trigger a reset.
